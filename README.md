# LIO-VHost

Executable virtual host controller for the LIO System. (Basically behaves like the LIO-Host software on embedded systems but uses an LED strip in GUI)

v2 Info: This branch will be pulled into main in the future. By that, the project's main language will switch from Java to Kotlin and the IDE files for Eclipse will be deleted since we switched over to IntelliJ IDEA.
